This week we held an internal hackathon to work on some interesting topics that 
are not part of our day to day work. This post gives a little context and 
describes the mini projects we tackled.

## Some Context

We, the Devex product development team, recently decided to dedicate more time 
to innovative ideas and learning about new approaches that are not directly 
related to our current product roadmap. A topic that came up pretty quickly was
data science. How can we do more with the data we arleady have? What else should
we be doing? How can we visualize important metrics? Which metrics are 
important? Etc.

Since we are a small team we can't just create a R&D department from scratch and
have to think about alternative, more subtle ways of moving into this kind of
work. Ideally these efforts will lead some to a tight integration of these 
efforts with our product development.

To get things started and make everyone excited about it, we thought that a 
hackathon would be the right thing. After defining some very basic rules and 
kicking off, it went down like this:

- Everyone could propose [ideas](https://github.com/Devex/research/tree/master/ideas) to be worked on
- Before starting we all picked a couple of ideas we would like to work on
- Based on these preferences we came up with small teams to work on three 
  different topics
- The hackathon lasted one day, teams working in a self-organized way
- We ordered pizza for lunch
- Presentation of results happened on the following day

## Project 1: Usage Metrics Visualization 

## Project 2: Creating a Keyword Corpus

## Project 3: Collaborative Filtering

## Conclusions
